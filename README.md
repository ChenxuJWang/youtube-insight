## Notes

- According to OpenAI, ChatGPT is experiencing exceptionally high demand. They work on scaling their systems but I can't guarantee that ChatGPT keeps free and is open forever.
- This code manually fetches the YouTube video transcripts, and the platform might change the system so I also cannot guarantee that the YouTube video transcript code works forever. I'll try my best to keep updated!
